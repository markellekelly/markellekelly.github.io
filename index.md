I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/research_group.html">DataLab</a> group at the University of California, Irvine, advised by Dr. Padhraic Smyth. I am broadly interested in the development of user-centered tools for more interpretable and accountable machine learning; my research centers on understanding and improving human-machine interaction. I'm a member of the <a href="https://create.ics.uci.edu/">Steckler Center for Responsible, Ethical, and Accessible Technology</a>, the <a href="https://ucinoyce.org/">Irvine Initiative in AI, Law, and Society</a>, and the <a href="https://hpi.ics.uci.edu/">HPI Research Center in Machine Learning and Data Science</a> at UCI.

I have previously interned with <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a>, working broadly on tools and processes for ML model evaluation, and at <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a>, where I was involved in the development and design of JupyterLab. I received my Bachelor's degree in statistics from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo in 2020 and my Master's degree in computer science from UCI in 2022.
